    "description": "Fire locations and perimeters that have recently updated information are retrieved from WFIGS sources every 15 minutes. A single fire is represented by a different geometry in each layer of the service. Perimeters are preferred over reported locations. If a perimeter is not available, a buffer on the reported location equal in area to the reported size of the fire is substituted. Analysis zones beyond perimeters and reported locations are defined at one, three, and five miles. Many attributes in this service are intended for use by specific applications and may not be intuitive to users in other contexts.<div><br /></div><div>This service is supported by a continuous development approach. Input information and user needs are expected to be dynamic. This is the first iteration of what should be viewed as a conceptual framework and not as a static product. As use-cases become established, more detailed documentation will be made available here. </div>",
